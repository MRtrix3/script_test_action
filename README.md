This package contains the requisite files to enable the Continuous Integration testing of all Python scripts contained within the *MRtrix3* software, including those that possess external neuroimaging software dependencies.

The action is defined in a separate repository in order to enable performing this testing within a Docker container.

It is defined entirely for the purposes of CI testing, and is unlikely to be of any utility to those outside of the *MRtrix3* development team.
